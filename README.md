### **Étapes du projet :**

#### 1. **📊 Data Collection :**
The data was sourced from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), a well-known platform providing detailed NBA statistics. The dataset includes:

- Steals
- Blocks per game
- Defensive rating
- Season
- many other data that are less relevant (date, points, assists...)

#### 2. **⚒️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
The raw data was extracted and cleaned using Python. The preprocessing steps included:

- Data Cleaning – Removed missing values, standardized column names, and handled outliers.

- Feature Engineering – Calculated additional metrics and joining datasets for better insights.

#### 3. **📈 Data Visualization with Tableau**
Once cleaned, the dataset was imported into Tableau for visualization. The final dashboard highlights trends in Gobert’s defensive stats over seasons
